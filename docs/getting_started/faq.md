### What does Byld do?

Byld is a tool to design, develop and deploy backends in an incredibly fast way.

### How is Byld different from Rails?

Byld isn't just a framework, though – we eliminate a lot of boilerplate code that application backends tend to require like transport, routing, messaging and infrastructure setup. Byld simplifies building backends by making you only write code that matters and let's you instantly deploy your backends without any additional setups.

It generally takes an engineer around ten minutes to understand the concepts of Byld., and 30 mins to develop and deploy your first backend. [Quick Start](../getting_started/quick_start)
