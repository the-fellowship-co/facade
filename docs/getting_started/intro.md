Byld lets you create backends in fast, easy and clean way.

## How does this work?

### Architect your backend using blocks

Model the different domains of your business instantly using byld blocks, an abstraction that only lets you write code that matters and eliminates the rest.

#### Communicate between blocks

Synchronous and asynchronous communication between blocks is always a simple function call.

#### Expose it to frontends using gates 

Power different web and mobile user interfaces with a great deal of flexibility using byld gates, a GraphQL based gateway.

#### Use our kits

Use our prebuilt blocks to assemble your backend rather than coding it from scratch.

#### Deploy instantly

Instantly deploy and scale without any infrastructure setups.
