Byld is a tool to design, develop and deploy backends in a incredibly fast way.

### How it works?

1. **Architect with blocks**: Use blocks to bootstrap the individual units of abstraction in your business/organisation.
2. **Communicate between blocks**: Make the blocks communicate in both asynchronous and synchronous way. 
3. **Expose blocks with gates**: Expose the blocks using to variety of frontends using gates.
4. **Deploy block and gates**: Instantly deploy the blocks and gates using a single cli command.
