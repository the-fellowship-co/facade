Byld is a tool to design, develop and deploy backends in an incredibly fast way.

### How it works?

1. **Architect with blocks** to abstract individual business units like order, payment, shipping etc..
2. **Communicate between blocks** using a simple function call or publishing/subscribing to events via in built pub/sub system.
3. **Expose blocks to frontends** using gate, a GraphQL gateway.
4. **Deploy blocks and gates** instantly using a single cli command.

Byld isn't just a framework, though – we eliminate a lot of boilerplate code that tradinational backends require like transport, routing, messaging and infrastructure setup. Byld simplifies building backends by making you only write code that matters and let's you instantly deploy your backends without any additional setups.

## Setting it up
