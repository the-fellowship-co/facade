## Deploying a block

Blocks eliminates all the infrasturcture related code needed to deploy your
block. Your migration will be run automatically before
deployment.

Use `byld deploy` from the block directory to deploy it. And check the status
of the deployment using `byld status` command.


## Testing a block

After deploying, you can test/debug your blocks from your local command line.

### Using interactive console

Use `byld console` to connect to your block's console. All the models are
loaded for testing.

```ruby
>> req = CreateUserReq.new(first_name: 'foo', last_name: 'bar')
>> user = User.client.create!(req)
>> User.client.activate(user.id)
```

You can use the block docs link from `byld status` to see all the interface method signature and defintions of the request and response types.

### Viewing logs

Use `byld logs` to view your block's logs in your command line.
